### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a final year PhD electrical engineering student at Texas A&M University. I was also an AI research lab intern at Nokia Bell Labs for Summer 2022, as well as the receipent of Texas A&Mâ€™s ECEN department PhD merit fellowship.

My interests cover Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), Algorithmic game theory, and applications of both on autonomous systems (e.g. robots and UAVs).

Outside of research, I like photography, running, going to the gym, and learning music.
