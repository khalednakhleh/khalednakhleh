### Hi there 👋

<!--
**khalednakhleh/khalednakhleh** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I am a third year PhD electrical engineering student at Texas A&M University. I am advised by Prof. I-Hong Hou. I am also an AI research lab intern at Nokia Bell Labs for Summer 2022, as well as the receipent of Texas A&M’s ECEN department PhD merit fellowship.

My interests cover Reinforcement learning, Multi-Armed Bandits, Machine Learning, and Learning Theory.

Outside of research, I like photography (you can follow me on Instagram), running, going to the gym, and learning music. I recently started learning mixing. My preferred Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) is Presonus Studio One.
