### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a final year PhD electrical engineering student at Texas A&M University. I was also an AI research lab intern at Nokia Bell Labs for Summer 2022, as well as the receipent of Texas A&Mâ€™s ECEN department PhD merit fellowship.

My interests cover Reinforcement learning, Multi-Armed Bandits, Machine Learning, and Learning Theory.

Outside of research, I like photography (you can follow me on Instagram), running, going to the gym, and learning music. I recently started learning mixing. My preferred Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) is Presonus Studio One.
